# Project Unit 1: A Simple Notepad

## Problem definition

My client, is an owner of a construction company who recently decided to implement a portable device where his crew can manage their tasks, look at required information such as passwords, and document occurences, while being outside at the construction site. The device they purchased, is portable and agile, with a small screen and a simple keyboard. However, the client cannot find an appropriate software for the device, because of the inability of the hardware to toggle a mouse pointer.

## Proposed Solution

The client is in need of a software where the user can interact with its software only by typing, without toggling the cursor. On top of the notepad function, for the crew to store passwords for gadgets or rooms that require one, there needs to be a password manager. The password manager itself should be protected by a password as well, because the device could often be placed away from its user while the user is engaged in a task, and the passwords in the manager shall not be leaked.

## Success criteria
(add corespondance to the solution)

Basic Tool Functionality

Notepad:
1.  Add new file, view and edit existing file, delete file
2.  Text files are stored in the directory
3.  User Interaction:
      - Uses the terminal to interact with the user.

Hidden Functionality:

1.  If the user enters the secret code, the program will change modes and act as a password manager
2.  In password manager mode, the user should be able to
      - Add a password
      - View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
      - Displays the passwords in a "masked" form
3.  Basic Security Features:
      - Stores passwords in a text file.
      - Basic obfuscation technique
4.  User Interaction:
      - Uses the terminal to interact with the user.
